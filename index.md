# John Stachurski

A brief self-introduction: I like mathematics and programming, which is
good because they occupy most of my waking hours, along with some of my
dreams..

Currently I am a professor at Australian National University, working on
optimization and equilibrium problems in economics and finance. I'm also
a co-founded of [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/), a US-based
nonprofit organization that supports open source software for
computational modeling in economics and related fields.

I have a book buying habit, especially when it comes to maths books.

In my spare time I enjoy table tennis, fishing, camping, cooking, riding
around on my
[F800R](http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2014/11/article/2015-bmw-f800r-first-look),
listening to music, hanging out with my family and drinking beer with my
buddies. Like my Dad, I am interested in world history and anything to
do with the ocean. Like my Mum, I love hiking and mountains.
