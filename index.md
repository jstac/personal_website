# John Stachurski

A brief self-introduction: I like mathematics and programming, which is
good because they occupy most of my waking hours, along with some of my
dreams.  Currently I'm based at Australian National University, working on
optimization and equilibrium problems in economics and finance. 

In 2016, [Tom Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/) and I founded
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/), a US-based nonprofit organization that
supports open source software for computational modeling in economics and
related fields. 

I have a book buying habit, especially when it comes to maths books.  In my
spare time I enjoy table tennis, fishing, camping, cooking, riding around on
my [F800R](http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2014/11/article/2015-bmw-f800r-first-look),
listening to music, hanging out with my family and drinking beer with my
buddies. Like my Dad, I am interested in world history and anything to do with
the ocean. Like my Mum, I love hiking, rivers and mountains.
