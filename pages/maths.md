hypocrites and demagogues, can be transformed into bloody dictatorships_

# Mathematics

## Interests

My interests are in probability, functional analysis and statistics. At
the moment, most of [my research](research) centers on numerical
analysis, stochastic processes and simulation.

## Books

![image](/images/mathprob.gif)

If you are interested in analysis and probability with a view to
mathematical economics then here is my reading list. I am extremely
fussy, and I think that all of these books are great.

### Introductory

- Introduction to Real Analysis, Bartle and Sherbet
- Abstract Analysis, Will Light

### Intermediate and Graduate texts

- An Introduction to Measure and Probability, J. C. Taylor
- Introductory Real Analysis, Kolmogorov and Fomin
- Probability with Martingales, D. Williams
- A Users Guide to Measure-Theoretic Probability, Pollard
- Principles of Real Analysis, Aliprantis and Burkinshaw
- Real Analysis and Probability, R. M. Dudley
- Measures, Integrals and Martingales by R. L. Schilling
- Analysis for Applied Mathematics, W. Cheney
- Probability and Stochastics, E. Cinlar

### Markov Chains

- Chaos, Fractals and Noise: Stochastic Aspects of Dynmaics, Lasota
  and Mackey
- Markov Chains and Stochastic Stability, Meyn and Tweedie.
- Discrete-Time Markov Control Processes, Hernandez-Lerma and Lassere
- Lectures on the Coupling Method, Lindvall

### Monographs, Other Topics

- Approximate Solutions of Operator Equations, Mark Krasnosel'skii
- Optimization by Vector Space Methods, Luenberger.
- Infinite Dimensional Analysis, Aliprantis and Border
- Lectures on the Coupling Method, Lindvall

The book by Bartle and Sherbert is where you should start. It is the
best introduction to analysis that I know. Kolmogorov and Fomin is a
nice read on functional analysis. Pollard has a great style and
interesting topics. He uses a non-standard notation that takes a while
to get your head around, but it's been kind of revolutionary for me in a
way. Aliprantis and Burkinshaw is an excellent graduate text with lots
of exercises. Dudley is great, but he frightens me a little bit.
Schilling is beautiful and useful. Cheney is beautiful too, and a nice
balance between theory and applications.

For background reading, try the wonderful book called "In Search of
Infinity" by N. Ya. Vilenkin.

### Writing Advice

## Other Bits and Pieces

I love the work of Escher, especially [this one](http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/m-c-escher/circle-limit-iv). And [here's](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/proof-that-girls-are-evil) an interesting little equation
about girls and evil.

Incidentally, the man generally recognized as the founder of modern functional analysis is
[Stefan Banach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach).
Many fundamental results in normed linear space stem from his 1922 thesis. Another important
contributor to the theory of abstract spaces was [Maurice Frechet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ren%C3%A9_Fr%C3%A9chet).
Frechet also helped generalize the Lebesgue integral to operate on functions of
arbitrary domain. Within the field of Markov processes, a bright and shining
light was created by the short career of [Wolfgang Doeblin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Doeblin). It's been a huge
privilege to understand and even contribute a tiny amount to his wonderful
ideas.
