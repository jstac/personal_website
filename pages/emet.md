**Random Quote:** _The goal of the scientist is to comprehend the
phenomena of the universe that he observes around him. To prove that he
understands he must be able to predict. To predict quantitatively one
must have a mechanism for producing numbers, and this necessarily
entails a mathematical model._ â€“ Richard Bellman

# A Primer in Econometric Theory

This is the homepage for my graduate level econometric theory text,
published [by MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/primer-econometric-theory).

## About

The following is from the preface to the book:

> This is a quick course on modern econometric and statistical theory, along
> with the underlying ideas from probability and linear algebra that
> budding econometricians should know. The focus is on foundations and general
> principles. Although it was written to teach from, there are many solved
> exercises, making the text well suited to self-study. Exercises, worked
> examples and sample code are used to reinforce ideas.

## Lecture Slides

Thanks to the work of
[Akshay Shanker](https://github.com/akshayshanker), a full set
of lectures slides are available [from GitHub](https://github.com/jstac/econometric_theory_slides) -- both PDF and source (TeX)

They are licensed under BSD-3 and you are free to modify them in any way
you wish.

## Source Code

The code in the book is written in a mixture of
[R](https://www.r-project.org/),
[Python](https://www.python.org/) and
[Julia](http://julialang.org/).  It is organized into
[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/),
which you can get by cloning [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/jstac/econometrics) or
just grabbing [the zip file](https://github.com/jstac/econometrics/archive/master.zip).

The next step is to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), which comes
bundled with the [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
Then, if you want to run the R and Julia code, you'll need the appropriate
kernels.  Search for documentation on how to run R and Julia code in a Jupyter notebook.
