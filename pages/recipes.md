**Random Quote:** _Ordinarily, people are anxious to test their theories
in practice, to learn from experience, but those who wield power are so
anxious to establish the myth of their own infallibility that they turn
their backs on the truth as squarely as they can. Politics means nothing
to me. I don’t like people who are indifferent to the truth._ – Boris

# Recipes

These are just my own notes so I don’t forget how to make the things I

to attribute them properly.

rest and simmer for an hour or so without lid until it reduces.

## Dakjuk

Recipe from [maangchi](http://www.maangchi.com/recipe/dakjuk) and
you should probably read it at the source

- 1 whole chicken
- 1.25 cups rice
- 2 eggs
- 3 green onion (negi) stalks
- 1.25 cups peeled garlic cloves

For the dipping sauce

- 2 tbs soy sauce
- 1 tbs each of vinegar and chopped negi

Trim fat from stomach / tail with scissors. Put the rice to soak in cold
water. At the same time, put the chicken in a large pot with 12 cups
water and the garlic. Bring to the boil, boiling over high heat for 40
minutes and then low-medium for 20. Now drain the rice and add it to the
pot. Cook for another 30 minutes, skimming excess fat with a ladel.

Take the chicken out of the pot and put it on the table to serve. Make
the dipping sauce. Finally, to the pot, add the beaten eggs and chopped
negi. Pause for 10 seconds for egg to cook, and then stir lightly. Serve
as soup.

Serve with salads and other fresh greens.

- 1.5 teaspoons mirin
- 25g enoki or simeji mushrooms
- 25g negi (green onion), just the white bit, sliced longways

Season fish with the sake and some pepper, let sit for 10 minutes. Put
onto small sheet of foil, add mushrooms and negi to the bottom of the
foil, and then salmon on top. Pour on mirin and soy sauce. Fold up foil
to make it air-tight, and then put on BBQ (or bake) for 10 minutes.

## Chicken Curry

Neither authentic nor original, but it makes a nice curry

- 500g chicken thighs

in tomato, coconut milk and peanut butter. Cover and bake for 45 minutes
or until chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened. Stir
through chopped coriander.

Good with home made naan — I’m still looking for a recipe I like

## Apple Pie

There are many variations, but here’s the way I like to make it

Pastry:

- 250g plain flour
- 125g butter
- 30g soft sugar
- 1 egg
- some cold milk

Filling:

- 5 green apples, a few sultanas, some lemon juice, sugar to taste

Preheat oven to 180°C. Make the pastry in a food processor. Add flour, butter, sugar to processor and pulse mix until it looks like breadcrumbs. Mix the egg and add about 80% of it, and then tiny bits of cold milk, mixing briefly each time, until it just starts to (or looks like it will) come together into a single mass. Pull it out, shape into a nice ball, put in cling wrap and leave in fridge for 15 minutes. In the meantime, cook the filling in a pot — nothing tricky here. Finally, roll out the pastry in two lots, bottom first. Put in filling, roll out and put on top. Brush on last bit of egg combined with a little milk and sugar. Bake for 45 minutes.

## Pizza Dough

- 153g plain flour
- 153g oo flour (high grade plain flour)
- 2~3g dry yeast
- 8g salt
- 4g olive oil

Combine flours and salt. Mix dry yeast with 200g lukewarm water. Add olive oil. Mix with flours. Knead with hands for about 3 minutes, until combined. Rest for 15 minutes. Knead again for 3 and then cut into 2 or 3 balls. (Three if, like me, you struggle with getting larger pizzas onto the stone.) Place under a damp cloth and let rise for 4 hours (or 24 in cling wrap in fridge).
