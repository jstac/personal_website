# Teaching

This page collects lecture slides for some courses I have taught.

## Graduate Macroeconomics 

These lecture slides are from the first quarter grad macro class I taught at
NYU.  I last taught this course in 2018.  The objective of this half semester
course was to introduce students to Markov dynamics, dynamic programming in
discrete time and other foundations.

* [Lecture 1: Introduction]()



## Undergraduate Mathematical Economics

I last taught this course in 2015 to second and third year undergraduate
students at ANU.  It contains a mix of optimization theory and dynamics.
